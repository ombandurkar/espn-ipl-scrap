## About
It is a web scraping project which scraps the IPL 2022 batting data from the ESPNcricinfo website and fills it in the Excel sheets.

## What exactly does it do?
* It forms a folder hierarchy that includes a top-level "IPL" folder and subfolders for each of the 10 teams.

* It creates a separate Excel sheet for each player and the player's statistics for each match he played, are saved in that Excel sheet, with each sheet being located within their respective team folder.
  
* The data is scraped from the website and inserted into the relevant folders and Excel spreadsheets.
  
* Each player’s sheet contains data like the player’s name, his team’s name, runs scored, balls faced, number of fours and sixes, strike rate, opposition teams name, date venue, and result of the match.
